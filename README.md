# oc - hey y'all!! this site is currently on break due to me trying to focus on schoolwork that's keeping me busy. I will return this in summer!! Sorry for the cutoff on the valentines day update - you can see this announcement with a wip of my valentines designs at spyoraptor.neocities.org/oc/home
oc site. no specific name because this is kind of a mixmatch for ocs i designed with no particular world/ strong concept in mind. 
-> [the website!!!](https://spyoraptor.github.io/oc/)

- its coded horribly right now lol. will work on that across time once i get better at structuring and organization. i'm not uploading the old code here cuz i'm not going through all the hassle of replacing it but yeah
- i couldnt bother to upload the old version, organization is garbage. so i just have from february onwards on here
- some updates are big, some small. i sprinkle little things each update depending on whether i'm busy or not or just don't feel like it.
- i aim to update every month in 2025, usually during special occasions.
- i'm a bit inconsistent with commissioning artists, but i really do want to do so. despite having already drawn an event-specific design myself, i still choose to look at other artists' works (mostly my friends for comfortable communication and of course i want to boost my friends!! even though i don't have much attention on me, at least right now lol)
- i have a horrible naming and descriptive sense please forgive me because me myself i do not know a lot about my ocs. just the designs,, ahahaha'

- list of features will be here soon!!!
